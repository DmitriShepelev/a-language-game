## Task description

Implement a [TranslateToPigLatin]() method that translates from English to [Pig Latin Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin), that obeys a few simple following rules:
1. If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an `"yay"` sound to the end of the word.
1. If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word. Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, a.k.a. a consonant cluster (e.g. `"chair" -> "airchay"`).
